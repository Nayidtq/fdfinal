## Introduction
The project consists of three main applications:

- `test_1.py`: Allows users to upload an image or use a webcam feed to detect and recognize faces.
- `test_2.py`: Focuses on detecting eyes, smiles, or other features using OpenCV or deep learning-based models. It also compares the similarity between two images by providing a percentage.
- `test_3.py`: An innovative application that combines face, eye, and smile detection in images. Built with Streamlit and powered by Cursor AI, it offers an intuitive user interface for real-time facial feature detection.

## Implementation Overview
The `test3_py` project is designed to offer an accessible, real-time image processing tool. Built with Streamlit, it allows users to upload images that are analyzed using advanced machine learning models provided by Cursor AI.

### Workflow
1. Image upload through Streamlit interface
2. Processing by detection models
3. Identification of regions of interest (faces)
4. Detection of specific features (eyes and smiles)
5. Comprehensive analysis of facial features

## Main Features

### 1. Face Detection
The main feature is the ability to accurately detect faces in uploaded images. Using Cursor AI's detection model and OpenCV's pre-trained algorithms, the application can:
